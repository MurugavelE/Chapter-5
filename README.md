# Chapter 5 - Ionic Directives and Services

## About this chapter

Reiterating our journey so far, we have started off by understanding the importance of AngularJS as a client-side MVW framework. We have gone through Apache Cordova, where and how it fits in to the entire hybrid application development stack. Then we introduced Ionic, explaining what it is and how it enables us to build hybrid applications with ease. In Chapter 3, Ionic CSS Components and Navigation, we saw how Ionic could be used as a CSS-only framework for your mobile web development, and in Chapter 4, Ionic and SCSS, we saw how we could theme those components using the power of SCSS.

In this chapter, we are going to take a look at Ionic directives and services, which provides reusable components and functionality that can help us in developing applications even faster. By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

 * Understand Ionic directives
 * Understand Ionic services
